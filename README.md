# SF_Benefits_Project
Data analysis and visualization on benefits across the San Francisco job market in different careers from 2011-2014

## GeoMapping Visualization

- Using leaflet and GeoMapping, a webpage was created to visualize the location and area of the city of San Francisco, and also depict a pop-up with stats such as area and population. 

- A circle with a radius corresponding to the area of the city was also used as a marker to depict the approximate size of the city
