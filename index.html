          <h2>Trends Observed in Benefits Offered From 2011-2014 in the San Francisco Job Market</h2>
          <p>Benefits offered in the job market in San Francisco in 2011 appear to be virtually none. However, as the years
            progress, we see an increase of benefits offered with jobs. This progression shows with each year. From this, we can 
            infer that the job market in San Francisco is improving with time, in offering benefits.
          </p>

          <p>Upon viewing total pay over the years, some outliers close to an annual income of $550,000 in 2011 have been observed. In 2014, outliers at $400,000 and $500,000 were observed.
            Not counting the 2 outliers in 2011, a consistent trend showing increase in annual income can be shown over the years.
            From here, we can infer a trend in better job prospects over the years. As the same trend is observed in overall pay with benefits,
            we can also infer that the benefits offered within the job market of San Francisco have improved
